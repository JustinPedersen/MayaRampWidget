![Ramp Demo](https://github.com/JustinPedersen/MayaRampWidget/blob/main/images/ramp_demo_02.jpg)

## Features
- Functions similarly to Autodesk Maya's Ramp widget, but is fully PySide2. No need to rip the widget from Maya with hacky workarounds. 
- Expandable and can be used in other softwares or standalone applications running Pyside.
- Select, add or remove markers to the gradient, either via code or by the user.
- Easy to interact with in code friendly manner to get the values from the ramp. 

## Demo 
See the `demo.py` file for an interactive demo the runs within autodesk Maya. 


## NOTE: 
- Py3 is required. The code can be modified to support py2 if you need but will need to be done on your own.
